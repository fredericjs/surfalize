## v0.15.1
- Fixed f-string bug occuring with older Python versions in CLI code.

## v0.15.0
- Added 3d plotting capabilities based on pyvista
- Added pyvista as optional dependency for 3d plotting
- Fixed bug in AutocorrelationFunction plotting
- Added Zygo Metropro DAT format reader
- Reworked Batch to preserve the order of parameters and operations by default. Before, all operations were executed 
  before parameter calculations. Now operations and parameters can be called in an interlaced manner and their order 
  will be executed in that order. This allows for cases where the user wants to calculate some parameters before and 
  others after a specific operation. The legacy behavior of performing all operations first can be activated by 
  specifying `presever_chaining_order=False` in `Batch.execute`
- Added docs for Batch processing changes
- Unified return values of plotting functions. Now all functions return either matplotlib figure and axes or a PIL image
  depending on the type of plot
- Refactored `Batch` implementation. `Batch` class now obtains the methods from the `Surface` class that are decorated
  with the `batch_method` decorator. The decorater specifies the type (parameter, operation) as well as possible return
  value names (replacing the previous decorator) and fixed keyword arguments such as `inplace = True` that must have
  a specific value for the Batch version of the method. A note is added to decorated methods of the `Surface` class, 
  indicating that it is suitable for Batch usage. The `Batch` class dynamically adds these methods to itself upon 
  instantiation (might change to a metaclass in the future) and adjusts the docstring, removing references to the fixed
  parameters.
- Added invert method to Surface class
- Previously, file readers checked using file magic whether a known file format that raised an exception during reading
  is actually a different format. Now, this capability has been extended to unknown file formats. Moreover, as a last 
  resort if no reader could be detected based on file magic, surfalize will try all available readers for that file and
  only then raise an exception if no reader is able to read the file.
- Added support for custom operations to Batch
- Extended documentation
- Added example file download module as `Surfalize.examples`
- Added indexing to `Surface`, which directly forwards indexing operations to the underlying `Surface.data` numpy array
- Added basic methods to `Surface`: `min`, `max`, `mean`, `median`, `std`

## v0.14.0
- Refactored the file reading and writing system
- Readers and writers now register in a FileHandler class with their suffix and file magic
- Readers and writers now work directly with file-like objects
- If the designated reader for a file determined from the file path suffix raises an Exception, if no suffix is provided
  or if no reader exists for that suffix, surfalize now tries to infer the correct reader from the file magic. This 
  helps in cases where the file format is unknown or the file is labeled with the wrong file extension.
- Added tests for reading from and writing to file-like objects
- File loader now issues warning if step_x and step_y are not equal
- Added support for file-like objects to batch processing
- Updated docs for working with file-like objects
## v0.13.2
- Ensured compatibility of trapezoid function with numpy versions (trapz for np < 2.X, trapezoid for > 2.X)

## v0.12.1
- Fixed bug where Surface.level would return only nan if surface has missing points
## v0.12.0
- Fixed string match in filename extraction to also include non alphabetic characters
- Batch.execute now returns BatchResult class instead of DataFrame, which wraps the DataFrame and exposes the same
  methods, but allows for other methods such as filename extraction on the result and potentially other methods in the
  future
- Fixed bug in orientation_fft
- Added vmin, vmax and show_cbar keyword to Surface.plot_2d
- Added SFLZ file format
- Refactored file layout reading and writing
- Replaced DataFrame with BatchResult as the return value for Batch.execute. BatchResult wraps the DataFrame but also 
  exposes additional methods, such as filename parameter extraction.
- Batch.execute now raises error if parameter is computed twice and overwritten
- Parameters in Batch can now be given a custom name using the custom_name kwarg to change the name of the column in
  the DataFrame. This allows for the computation of multiple versions of the same parameter
- Removed numpy dependency restriction to versions below 2.0

- Fixed incorrect calculation of standard deviation for Gaussian filter (thanks to Dorothee HÃ¼ser for the correction)
## v0.8.1
- Added kwarg to Gaussian filter to define endeffect management method
- Sinusoid now raised FittingError when fitting fails
- Batch.execute now uses threadpool instead of multiprocessing to avoid issues with jupyter and pickling, while
  maintaining almost the same speed gains due to frequent GIL release in numpy-based computations

  topography files as a convenience function
- Fixed bug with loading Gwyddion exported SUR files due to Gwyddion filling strings with null instead of spaces
- Added OPD file format (OPD files may have differing values of step_x and step_y, this could cause unexpected errors 
  in the calculation of some parameters)

- Fixed and simplyfied the calculation of the DFT peaks
- Added cropping to Batch
## v0.5.0
- Added algorithm for computing texture orientation with significantly higher precision than the current fft-based 
  method. The purely fft-based method can still be selected via keyword argument.
- Replaced functools.lru_cache with custom cache implementation since lru_cache causes memory leaks when applied to 
  instance methods. This would result in a substantial memory leak during batch processing because the surface objects
  would not be garbage collected once they went out of scope. 
- Added cache to the height paramters, reducing calculation time by ~20% since Sq is invoked multiple times. 
- Fixed dtype mismatch in Cython code for topographies with float32 instead of float64 dtype (usually plu and plux 
  files)

- Surface.align now takes axis argument to specify with which axis to align the texture
- Surface.depth now considers orientation of the structure and uses correct period in x or y depending on it. It also
  now uses either horizontal or vertical profiles depending on the orientation. Moreover, it doesn't compute the period
  initial guess from each profile anymore but only once from the fourier transform.
- Reworked file loading code and added support for .sur files
- Added basic operator overloading for arithmetic operations to Surface, e.g. "surface + 5.2" or "surface1 - surface2"
- Added Gaussian filter and removed FFT-filter. Surface.filter now invokes a Gaussian filter. 
## v0.3.0:
- Removed underscore from Surface._data, ._step_x, ._step_y, ._width_um, ._height_um since they are supposed to be
  public attributes
- Fixed bug in Surface.zoom
- Reworked Batch processing: now implements lazy loading and dispatch to multiple processes for faster load time
- Operations and Parameters now are constructured as a pipeline on the Batch object, with the actual execution only
  taking place once Batch.execute is called
